# Hey, I'm Rushbh

I build things with AI and backend systems. Most of my work involves LLMs, RAG pipelines, and automation. Also spend way too much time on Linux.

**What I work with:**
- Python, FastAPI, Firebase
- LLMs & AI Agents (LangChain, OpenAI, Gemini)
- Git, Linux, n8n
- typescript, bun, mastra.ai
